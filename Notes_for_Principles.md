# Notes for Principles by Ray Dalio
> I want you to think yourself - to decide 1) what you want, 2) what is true, and 3) what to do about it. I want you to do that in a clear-headed, thoughtful way, so that you get what you want. I wrote this book to help you do that. I am going to ask only two things of you - 1) that you be open-minded and 2) that you honestly answer some questions of what you want, what is true, and what you want to do about it.

# Introduction
> Principles are concepts that can be applied over and over again in similar circumstances as distinct from narrow answers to specific questions. Every game has principles that successful players master to achieve winning results. So does life. Principles are ways of successfully dealing with the laws of nature or the laws of life.
